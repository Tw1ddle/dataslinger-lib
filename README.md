Data slinger is a C++17 library for asynchronously passing data between processes on the same computer or over a network.

See the [demo](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/dataslinger) repository for examples.

## Features

 * WebSocket client and server support built on with Boost Beast.
 * Pipe-based interprocess communication (work in progress).
 * Shared memory interprocess communication using Boost Interprocess (work in progress).

## Usage

Create Slinger objects, passing in callbacks and the ConnectionOptions for the backend you want to use, then start sending byte data and polling the slingers.

## Building

Requires C++17 support, depends on boost 1.78.0 and [concurrentqueue](https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue).
